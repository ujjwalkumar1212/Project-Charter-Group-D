## Client comments:

After watching our presentation and listing to us, Dr. Hoot suggested few changes which are mentioned below:

- For an Instructor page, normal login details would be good rather than using extra information.
- In the Instructure home page, there is no use of survey percentage attribute.
- In student registration page, lookup classes and add/drop classes need not be necessary.
- In student home page, the contents like test scores and student records are not that relevant and they should be changed.
- Sample data needs to be added into the sample data table.
- Real-time database has to be introduced.
- More entities has to be added in the real-time database like admin, instructor and student.
- Our web application should be restricted to only one login page.
- From and To dates are required while adding a course in instructor page.
- For adding a course, "+" symbol at the top corner of UI will look more relevent instead of clicking on add/drop courses.
- Link for reset password is required.
- Instructor should be able to view the percentage of student who has retrieved their code just beside the course name instead of clicking on any link to view that which would redirect the instructor to another page.
- Roles pages should be updated with more generic information which should include all the roles and responsibilities for students, instructor and admin.
- We need to create data in differet sets which may include set of 80 datas, set of 500 datas and set of 5000 datas also.
- User stories need to be in more detail like I want to do "specific task".
- There should not be multiple login pages, instead only one login page will work.
- There should be different link options for admin,instructor and student login in same login page.
-  The admin,instructor and student pages must different from each other.
- Before login, Instructor/student should be able to register himself/herself as registration is always done befor doing login.
- We need to think for "GENDER" option or remove it as our Dr. Hoot was not fully satisfied with that option.
- Instead of clicking on Gender option, other option creative option can be added as well. 
- There should be a URL that should direct user directly to the Survey page from our application page.
