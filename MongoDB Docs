MongoDB is an open source document database and uses NoSQL.
Here the code is written in c++.
It is an cross-paltform and it is document oriented database that provides high performance, availability and scalability and it works on concepts like collection and document.
In collections database is a physical container and it has several databases.
Collections is nothing but it is a group of MongoDB components and sometimes this acts like an RDBMS table.
We will have many collections in a single database and it do not enforce an schema.
In collections there are different documents that has different fields.
In collections there are similar documents and there will be all related with each other.
And it has documents that has a variety set of key value pairs and it has dynamic schema.
Dynamic schema is that documents in the collections they do no need to have same set of fields or like common fields has different types of data.
Another important thing in MongoDB is no concept of relationship.
we can use MongoDB in Big Data, Data Hub, User data management, mobile and social infrastructure and content management and delivery.
