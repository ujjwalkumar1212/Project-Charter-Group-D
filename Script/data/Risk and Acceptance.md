## Risk


The following have been identified as risks that could contribute to not making scope, budget, or schedule:

- The client changes requirements mid-project...
- Early and effective communication of project issues to organization and project stakeholders.
- An effective team building tool, as team buy-in and acceptance is assured.

To control Risk management we have to follow certain principles:

The organization-mandated risk management framework is reviewed and tailored to define the project risk management plan when the project is initiated. The risk management plan includes these definitions and guidelines:

- List of possible risk sources and categories
- Impact and probability matrix
- Risk reduction and action plan
- Risk threshold and metrics


## Acceptance criteria

- Backup and Restore testing have to been completed successfully.
- All requirements have to be formally approved.
- User acceptance testing (UAT) has to be completed.
- The Senior User/Project Executive has to be signed off on user acceptance testing.

- For each story, enumerate and clearly describe the acceptance criteria.
- Be specific - your client may have a very different definition of vague words.
