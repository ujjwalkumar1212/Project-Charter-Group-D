For an Instructor page normal login details would be good rather than using extra information.
In the Instructure home page there is no use of survey percentage attribute.
In student registration page lookup classes and add/drop classes need not be necessary.
And in student home page the contents like test scores and student records are not that relevant they should be rechanged.

We have to add sample data tables
For Instructor Student and SID and details in a table.
Our web application should be restricted to only one login page.
In instructor page, we have to use from and to dates when adding a course.
We have to use + symbol for adding a course, this idea which was given by Dr. Hoot
Also link for resetting password.
