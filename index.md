## Project Purpose
This project involves creating an app that issue confidential codewords to each student in a course. Course instructors must not know what code word is given to each student. 

## Benefits
The application will be important to improve the statistical significance of results from pre- and post-surveys, by allowing instructors to match pre-to-post responses, without compromising the confidentiality of the surveys.

## User Roles
This application is used by Students.

1. Administrator
2. User
3. Instructor


## Stories by Role


## Administrator Perspective

Admin needs to access the Student and Instructor login pages.

Admin need not to know the students codeword.

Admin needs to protect the information from both the Instructor and Student end. 

## Student Perspective

Student would like to receive the codeword as soon as survey was completed.

Student need to access to their login page correctly

## Instructor Perspective

Instructor would like to have only one login page for Instructor and Student.

Instructor would like to have end and start date for the courses.

Instructor would like to have the survey percentage on the home page itself rather than that survey page redirecting to an other page.

Sravya Kancharla - As a user I want to make an app which can be more specific so that we have competency levels with others.

Vyshnavi Yalamareddy - As a user I want to come up with ways to communicate our ideas so that I can eliminate misunderstandings between client and development team.

Srimai Reddy Yanala - As a user I want to visualize the screen-to-screen interaction admin and user, so that our idea will be visible and clear in user interface form.

Anurag Kumar - As a user I want to collect data and get a good relationships among people, objects, places, concepts or events within that system as I want to be used in computing in regard to the organization.

Ujjawal Kumar - As a user I would be taking care of designing the database and designing ER diagrams, creating database, performing CURD operations, connecting the applications with the database, etc.

## Scope

Our main aim is to create a web application that works on platform iPhone SE and to distribute the code words among the students and those code words will not match with the other students in the same class.

### Phase 1 - Conception and initiation (Module 1)

Phase 1 involves a friendly competition between muliple teams, 
each completing a quick (2-week, 1 module) exercise to develop a vision for the project 
on a given platform. In competitions, this exercise may be done in an afternoon. 
During Phase 1, the teams will work independently and each vision will be shared with the client. 

Deliverables:

- Project charter
- Supporting artifacts (as described in this document).
- Contract (This is an agreement to deliver the project successfully to the client with help of 5 members team in 14 weeks time period with an approximate amount of 30,000 dollars)

This phase includes the development of:

- [Stories by role](https://github.com/ujjwalkumar1212/Project-Charter-Group-D/blob/master/Script/Role.md)
- [Initial acceptance criteria]()
- [E-R diagram](https://github.com/ujjwalkumar1212/Project-Charter-Group-D/blob/master/Script/ER%20diagram/entity.png)
- [Sample data](https://github.com/ujjwalkumar1212/Project-Charter-Group-D/raw/master/Script/data/CodeExcel.xlsx)

- [RFP](https://github.com/profcase/rfp-codewords/blob/master/index.md)
- Planned Schedule for these three months:

- For each phase, initial scope, schedule, budget (included in this document)
- As per the schedule by the end of semester we would submit the whole requirements which requires upto $30,000.


### Phase 2 - Definition and planning (Module 2 and 3)

During Phase 2, the best parts of each platform-specific charter will be used to create a single, 
consolidated charter that allows different platforms to share fundamental aspects such as the E-R diagram and 
sample data.

Deliverables:

- Combined project charter
- Integrated supporting artifacts (taking the best from Phase 1)

Include:

- Final stories by role (see above)
- Final acceptance criteria (see above)
- Final E-R diagram (link)
- Final set of sample data (link)
- Detailed project sketches by platform (link - images must be displayed)
- Architectural decisions, including platforms, languages, frameworks, libraries, cloud resources, data stores, releases, milestones, authentication, authorization, responsive supports, progressive supports, security, performance requirements, traditional or SPA, client-side rendering vs server-side rendering, REST vs GraphQL, web vs native vs hybrid, etc.
- List of projects with versions in JIRA
- Schedules for sprints, client presentations, milestones and acceptance criteria in JIRA
- Construction of product backlogs built from epics, stories, tasks, and subtasks in JIRA

### Phase 3 - Implementation of architectural prototypes (Module 4 and 5)

During Phase 3, new teams will be defined to work in parallel (again in friendly competition) to build platform-specific architectural prototypes to identify any major issues with the plan. 

Deliverables:

- Updated versions of all artifacts
- JIRA management system
- Working prototype deployed in each proposed platform
- Presentation of architectural prototype to client and extended team (include pros & cons of these choices).
- Together with the client decide what platform(s) will be selected for implementation.
- Client acceptance of the plan

### Phase 4 - System requirement specification (Module 6)

Based on the results and lessons learned during the architectural prototypes, finalize the requirements to be used during the coming implementation phase.

Finalize implementation plan (including all remaining phases along with scope, schedule, and budget by phase).

Deliverables:

- Complete implementation plan for next semester.
- Suggested project organization for next semester.
- Signed acceptance by the client with comments.

## Budget

Bill estimation of phase1 for two weeks:

Part 1 - Artifacts to which I have contributed

Week 1
- Project Charter for iOS (any link)
- App(https://ujjwalkumar1212.github.io/Project-Charter-Group-D/)

- Project Charter for iOS repository (https://github.com/ujjwalkumar1212/Project-Charter-Group-D.git)

Week 2
(Copy, paste and just keep adding to it each week.... by the end, you will have a record of all your artifacts).

Part 2 - My personal contributions (Cumulative list by week)

Week 1 - REQUIRED: $1100  ($200 in-class + 3 commits, each worth 4 hours for $300)
$200 - On-time attendance at three class/client 1-hour meetings (see course attendance)
$100 - Created repo, invited team members, published initial version (link to my commit)
$200- Drafted the schedule for our charter based on team discussions, web page gantt chart (link to commit)
$300 - Expanded the risk section of the project charter (link to my commit)
$300 - Expanded the risk section of the project charter (link to my commit)
Week 2 - REQUIRED: $1100  ($200 in-class + 3 commits, each worth 4 hours for $300)
(Copy, paste and just keep adding to it each week.... by the end, you will have a record of all your contributions).

Present project budget table here.

- Budget must be by phase by team role.
- For each role, assume each contributor will be working 10-12 billable hours per week for 15 weeks per semester.
- Use real-world billing rates. A company must bill you at twice your salary or more - practice proving your worth.
- Within the team, be specific on what each role will contribute to the budget and how this will be documented.

## Risk


The following have been identified as risks that could contribute to not making scope, budget, or schedule:

- The client changes requirements mid-project...
- Early and effective communication of project issues to organization and project stakeholders.
- An effective team building tool, as team buy-in and acceptance is assured.

To control Risk management we have to follow certain principles:

The organization-mandated risk management framework is reviewed and tailored to define the project risk management plan when the project is initiated. The risk management plan includes these definitions and guidelines:

- List of possible risk sources and categories
- Impact and probability matrix
- Risk reduction and action plan
- Risk threshold and metrics


## Acceptance criteria

- Backup and Restore testing have to been completed successfully.
- All requirements have to be formally approved.
- User acceptance testing (UAT) has to be completed.
- The Senior User/Project Executive has to be signed off on user acceptance testing.

- For each story, enumerate and clearly describe the acceptance criteria.
- Be specific - your client may have a very different definition of vague words.
