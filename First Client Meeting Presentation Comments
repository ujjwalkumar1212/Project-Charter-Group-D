For an Instructor page normal login details would be good rather than using extra information.
In the Instructure home page there is no use of survey percentage attribute.
In student registration page lookup classes and add/drop classes need not be necessary.
And in student home page the contents like test scores and student records are not that relevant they should be rechanged.
